# Horiseon-

This is a webpage that was updated to a have Semantic tags. I changed the links and addded alternative tags for the disabled and impaired on the pictures. I changed the styles sheet to have headers, sections, and asides. I also aligned the webpage and fixed the footer, links and rearrange the order of the pictures and button links.
